    #                              If the QoI depends on the sampling in nbParam points of a physical system parameter

    #                              f_1,...,f_nbParam are the nbParam sampling points, the components of the QQ vector must be organized 
    #                              as follows:

    #                     WARNING: If nbParam > 1, this means that nq_obs is equal to nqobsPhys*nbParam, in which nqobsPhys is the number
    #                              of the components of the state variables that are observed. Consequently, nq_obs/nbParam must be

    #                     WARNING: NOTE THAT if such a parameter does not exist, it must be considered that nbParam = 1, but the
