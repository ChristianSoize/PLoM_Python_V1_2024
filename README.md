# Brief Description of the PLoM Software

The "PLoM_Python_V1_2024" package is the Python conversion of the Matlab code "PLoM_Matlab_V1_2024," which is available on GitHub.

The PLoM (Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds) software is a Python-based toolbox designed to perform advanced probabilistic modeling 
and learning on manifolds. It is particularly useful for analyzing high-dimensional data from small datasets, reducing dimensionality, 
and capturing complex relationships in data through a probabilistic approach. The toolbox provides various types of analyses that 
facilitate the construction of probabilistic models on manifolds and statistical surrogate models, making it a powerful tool for 
researchers and practitioners in fields such as scientific machine learning, data science, and applied mathematics.

The development of the PLoM software is grounded in the research published in the articles listed at the end of this file.  Numerous 
applications of this software can also be found in the published literature.

The software's capabilities are demonstrated through 9 Benchmarks. Each Benchmark illustrates a specific type of analysis that can be 
performed, with fully defined data sets and the associated results generated by PLoM.

    For the supervised analysis the information structure is 
    XX = (QQ,WW) with dimension n_x = n_q + n_w, 


# How to use PLoM Software 

PLoM starts with the Python function run.py, in which two main parameters must be provided by the user: the number nbworkers, which 
determines the number of workers for parallel computation, and the parameter ind_workflow, which specifies the type of analysis 
as follows:
          - "ind_workflow = 1": WorkFlow1_SolverDirect_WithoutPartition
          - "ind_workflow = 2": WorkFlow2_SolverDirect_WithPartition
          - "ind_workflow = 3": WorkFlow3_SolverInverse_WithoutPartition

Depending on the type of analysis, the following files need to be specified in the run.py function as follows:

- For "ind_workflow = 1" (WorkFlow1_SolverDirect_WithoutPartition):
       from mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow1 import mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow1
       mainWorkflow(nbworkers, ind_workflow, mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow1)

- For "ind_workflow = 2" (WorkFlow2_SolverDirect_WithPartition):
       from mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow2 import mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow2
       mainWorkflow(nbworkers, ind_workflow, mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow2)

- For "ind_workflow = 3" (WorkFlow3_SolverInverse_WithoutPartition):
       from mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow3 import mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow3
       mainWorkflow(nbworkers, ind_workflow, mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow3)          

**For executing PLoM:**

(1) Create a directory "Name", for instance: "PLoM_project1".

(2) In this directory "Name":
- Place the subdirectory "PLoM_software_PYTHON_functions_V1" (do not change the name), containing all the python functions of PLoM.  
- Create a subdirectory "subName" (for instance, Benchmark1_Direct_NoPartition_CondStat_pdf) containing the function:
   - run.py (whose content is defined above)
   - and:
     - If ind_workflow = 1: two functions, mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow1.py and mainWorkflow_Data_generation1.py, and one data file, 
                            FileMatRxxData, are required.
     - If ind_workflow = 2: two functions, mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow2.py and mainWorkflow_Data_generation1.py, and one data file,
                            FileMatRxxData, are required.
     - If ind_workflow = 3: three functions, mainWorkflow_Data_Workflow3.py, mainWorkflow_Data_generation1.py, and 
                            mainWorkflow_Data_generation2.py, and two data files, FileMatRxxData and FileMatRxxTargetj with j = 1, 2, 
                            or 3 for target type 1, 2, or 3, are required.
   
(3) To execute PLoM, in the subdirectory "subName", enter: "python run.py" in the prompt.
